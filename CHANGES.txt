0.2.0

- Changed installation type to work as a Python package via setup.py

0.1.0

- Users coming from versions 0.0.4 and older cannot upgrade to 0.1.0 with pacha --upgrade
- Added Sqlite3 that will effectively break on Python versions older than 2.5

0.0.4

- --upgrade has been rebuilt to grab the latest .tar.gz from the homepage instead of pulling changes via Mercurial. 
Some info about what is going on when you upgrade is now displayed.
- master = True If you are a Pacha user from any previous version, you will need to add the following line to pacha 
for your master server: master = True
This will tell the daemon to run: hg update on your host repositories so you can always see the latests changes 
(when a server pushes changes, files do not get updated via mercurial).
- More tests have been added to Pacha which have triggered some re-coding at some of the libraries. It is always 
great to be able to test specific functionality of Pacha to make sure we have the right results.
- Faster Pacha! On most of the Mercurial calls Pacha was making on the backend, we were actually forking a 
subprocess to run hg. Speed has increased a lot since we are now calling and import modules straight from Mercurial.
